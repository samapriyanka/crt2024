Area calculation
Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in a square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input Format

First input: a side of a square in integer Second input: length of a rectangle in integer Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Constraints

1<=side of square <=10**9 1<=length of rectangle<=10**9 1<=breadth of rectangle<=10**9 1<=radius<=10**9

Output Format

The first output should be the area of a square in integer The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */ 
    int a,b,c;
    float d;
    scanf("%d%d%d%f",&a,&b,&c,&d); 
    int r1=a*a;
    printf("%d\n",r1);
    int r2=b*c;
    printf("%d\n",r2);
    float r3=3.14*d*d;
    printf("%.2f",r3);
    return 0;
